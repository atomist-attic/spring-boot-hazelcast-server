The NewSpringBootHazelcastServer Generator creates a new [Spring
Boot][boot] [REST][rest] service project.

[boot]: https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
[rest]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this generator.

#### Parameters

To run this generator you must supply the following parameters.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
`project_name` | Yes | |  A valid GitHub repository name.  It must be 21 characters or less to avoid truncating name when the its Slack channel is created.
`artifact_id` | No | myartifact | Maven artifact ID, e.g., "fiddle-riddle".
`group_id` | No | mygroup |  Maven group ID, e.g., "com.pany.project".
`version` | No | 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT | [Semantic version][semver] of the project.
`description` | No | Hazelcast Server | A brief description of the project.
`new_package` | No | mygroup | The package for the generated service class.
`main_class_name` | No | MyCaster | Name for the generated service class.

[semver]: http://semver.org

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:NewSpringBootHazelcastServer \
    pet-shop-service \
    artifact_id=pet-shop \
    group_id=uk.co.lndn \
    version=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    description="Spring Boot Hazelcast service for selling stuff" \
    new_package=uk.co.lndn.electronic \
    main_class_name=PetShop
```

Note the first parameter, the `project_name`, is different in that you
do not need to supply the name of the parameter, just the value.  This
is because the `project_name` parameter is required for all
generators.  This will create a directory named `pet-shop-service` and
populate it with a working Spring Boot REST service.  If you are happy
with the change, commit the changes.

```
$ cd pet-shop-service
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial version generated by Atomist'
```

See the README in the generated project for further instructions.
